# Scripts

- `npm run start` runs your app for development, reloading on file changes
- `npm run build` builds your app and outputs it in your `dist` directory
- `npm run start:build` runs your app after it has been built using the build command
- `npm run lint` runs the linter for your project


# Tooling configs

For most of the tools, the configuration is in the `package.json` to reduce the amount of files in your project.

If you customize the configuration a lot, you can consider moving them to individual files.
